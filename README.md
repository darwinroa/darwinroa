<h3 align="center">Full Stack Developer | WordPress | React | Node | Express | PostgreSQL | CSS | HTML</h3>

- ðŸ“„ [Full Stack developer with more than 4 years of experience in WordPress, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and PHP. I also started in the Full Stack world in the Bootcamp called Soy Henry, where I learned React, Node, Express, PostgreSQL and Sequelize. Being React with which I developed the most. My experiences: As a WordPress web developer, I have worked for different Marketing Agencies where I have made websites for different purposes, such as medical offices, tourism, virtual stores, sex education, among others. Among the most important projects in which I have participated as a developer with WordPress, has been working together with a team of developers to make the Eucolait (http://eucolait.eu/) and YSAFE IPPF (https://ysafe. net/ippf). Where Eucolait is the European dairy trade community, and YSAFE IPPF is the Association safe from sexual and gender-based violence in Europe and Central Asia. Also, as a student in Henry's Bootcamp, I developed two projects required to pass the bootcamp, where I demonstrated what I learned in Node, Exrpess, React, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Git. In these projects, user control, combined filters, payment gateways, administration area, emails, notifications, among others, were worked on. Who I am? I am an honest and responsible person, a good companion and with a good sense of humor. I have good soft skills such as being communicative and participatory, I am not ashamed to speak in public even if my nerves are present. I like to be good at what I do, applying good practices to everything. Eventually I like to take some time to ride my bike so I can distract my mind a bit and then have more concentration to solve complex tasks.](Full Stack developer with more than 4 years of experience in WordPress, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and PHP.
